    <summary>3D Facial Image Visualisation, Measurement, Analysis</summary>

    <description>
        <p>Cliniface lets clinicians interactively visualise, measure, analyse, and export data and reports
            about 3D facial images taken of their patients. Cliniface records a comprehensive range of facial
            measurements and compares these against known statistics of facial growth to automatically identify
            significant dysmorphic traits as standard Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms which have
            disease/gene associations. By combining the HPO terms reported by Cliniface with other phenotypic
            information (including medical/family histories etc), a clinician is better able to quickly and
            accurately arrive at a potential diagnosis. Cliniface can then summarise the analysis in a PDF
            report, or export the analysis to CSV (or other text formats) for detailed follow-up investigations if required.
        </p>
        <p>Cliniface takes over fifty measurements from different parts of the face including distances,
            depth, angles, and asymmetry. In addition, Cliniface offers clinicians the ability to record their
            own measurements on the 3D facial image in an intuitive and easy manner using "virtual callipers".
            Visualisations of asymmetry and curvature are also provided to help clinicians more effectively
            interpret the facial surface.
        </p>
        <p>Cliniface works with 3D facial models stored in a wide variety of formats including formats without
            texture information. The protection and privacy of subject information is ensured because all
            processing is carried out on your own machine.
