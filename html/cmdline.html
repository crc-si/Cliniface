<center><h1>Command Line Interface</h1></center>
<hr>

<p>While primarily an interactive application, Cliniface exposes a simple command line interface for
some common operations that are useful when writing scripts to collate data from multiple 3D images.
Run the Cliniface executable from the command line with the -h or --help switch to see all available options.
</p>

<p>Cliniface can convert 3D images from one format to another and export metadata about a 3D image from the
command line. Passing a path to a single 3D image file causes Cliniface to open it in its user interface.
However, passing a second file or directory path causes Cliniface to convert the first file to the format
specified by the suffix/extension of the second file path. If the second path has no suffix, the path is
treated as a directory (which is created if it doesn't already exist), and a 3DF is saved
into the given directory. The default filetype is 3DF, but a different output filetype can be specified.
However, if a non-3DF file is specified, landmarks and other metadata are not saved.
Allowed output formats for model conversion/export are OBJ, PLY, STL, U3D, and 3DF.
</p>

<p>If a file already exists at the output destination, you will be asked to confirm (y/yes) overwriting
of the file. Pass the -f or --force switch to skip confirmation and force through any potential overwrite.
</p>

<p>The command below converts <code>myimage.obj</code> to PLY format and saves it within directory
<code>path_to_output</code>:
</p>
<code>cliniface path_to_file/myimage.obj path_to_output/myimage.ply</code>

<p>Both of the commands below generate a 3DF from <code>myimage.obj</code> and save it in
directory <code>path_to_output</code>:
</p>
<code>cliniface path_to_file/myimage.obj path_to_output/myimage.3df</code><br>
<code>cliniface path_to_file/myimage.obj path_to_output</code>

<p>Face extraction and landmark detection/mapping can also be performed from the command line.
However, it is usually necessary to view the generated 3DF files in Cliniface's user interface
and confirm or adjust landmark positions. To identify and reject non-face parts of the model,
pass the -c or --cut switch. Pass the -m or --m switch to perform mask/landmark mapping.
Facial extraction is performed before landmark mapping if both switches are passsed.
The command below extracts the face, detects and maps landmarks, and saves the output
at <code>path_to_file/myimage.3df</code>:
</p>
<code>cliniface path_to_file/myimage.ply -cm</code>

<p>To export only the mask that was found and mapped to the input face as part of the landmark detection/mapping
process, pass the -k or --mask switch. The command below exports just the mask from a previously generated
3DF file to <code>mask.ply</code> in the current directory:
</p>
<code>cliniface path_to_file/myimage.3df -k mask.ply</code>

<p>With a 3DF file as input (or after passing the -m switch), metadata about
the landmarks and measurements extracted by Cliniface can be exported. This
is performed by specifying an output file with one of the export format extensions: csv, xml, or json.
See <a href="fileformats.html">here</a> for more information about exporting metadata to these formats.
The command below exports the metadata contained in myimage.3df to the named CSV file:
</p>
<code>cliniface path_to_file/myimage.3df path_to_metadata/myimage.csv</code>
