<center><h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1></center>
<hr>

<h2>Does Cliniface diagnose rare diseases?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
No. It takes a lot more information than just knowing a few measurements about the
face to be able to have a good idea about a person's health. Cliniface is meant to
be used by health professionals in a clinical context to quickly and efficiently
gain accurate objective measurements and indications of facial abnormalities.
That information needs to be integrated with a whole lot of other phenotypic
information, patient histories, medical expertise, and experience in order
to synthesise something approaching a diagnosis.
</p>

<h2>Do the images loaded into Cliniface remain private?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Yes. Cliniface does all processing locally and doesn't send your data anywhere or collect
any summary information or statistics or anything at all like that.
</p>

<h2>Why doesn't the loaded 3D image show the facial texture?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
This can happen for two main reasons: either the texture was not loaded (it couldn't
be found in the specification of the model), or the model's vertices are stored
incorrectly. If the texture was not loaded then the surface of the model will be
shown (the plain geometry) without the mapped image. If the vertices are stored
incorrectly then the "front" of the face will be masked from the camera's initial
viewpoint - check if this is the case or not by toggling backface culling off
(press <em>B</em>). If turning off backface culling allows the front surface
of the model to be seen, then use Cliniface's <em>Invert Normals</em> function
under the <em>Geometry</em> menu to fix the issue.
</p>

<h2>Can the accuracy of face / landmark detection be improved?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Registration of the anthropometric mask against the target surface (the selected face) looks
at the entirety of the model when registering the mask to the face. For better registration, crop out
non-facial regions using the <em>Extract Facial Region</em> tool under the <em>Geometry</em> menu.
after selecting the region to crop with the radial selection tool. Also, every time face detection
is run, a new initial rigid pose is calculated from the current position of the model so simply
moving the model into a different position with respect to the camera may help.
The best way to see how well mask registration is working is to toggle off the model
texture (press <em>T</em>) and any landmarks if visible (press <em>L</em>) and toggle
visualisation of the mapped mask on and off (press <em>C</em>).
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
You can also try adjusting the parameters of the non-rigid registration algorithm
via Cliniface's <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>. Increasing the number of
iterations (at the cost of slower detection) will improve accuracy.
To find out more about how the algorithm works, refer to the original
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-42533-y">paper</a>.
</p>

<h2>Can I still use 3D face models if they're poor quality?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Cliniface is pretty robust to poor surface geometry so maybe! Cliniface
comes with some features to help clean up the facial geometry. Some of this happens automatically
when loading the model; only parts of a model having large numbers of connected
polygons are loaded.
Cliniface also has tools for smoothing and hole filling (though hole filling
is quite simplistic and meant more for small holes). You can also manually
crop away parts of the image that are too degraded. There's even a
tool to flip the triangle surface normals if the system you've used to generate
the model has stored the triangle vertices clockwise rather than anti-clockwise.
</p>

<h2>Is my face really that asymmetric?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
You've loaded your face into Cliniface, run the automated registration algorithm, and
opened an asymmetry visualisation have you? The accuracy of it depends largely on
the accuracy of the initial face registration against the anthropometric mask and
the subsequent alignment. If you have doubts about the quality of the registration
process, check the result by pressing <em>C</em> to toggle the registered mask on
and off. You can also re-run detection which will re-map the mask (perhaps
after you've cleaned up the geometry some too). See the answer above about improving
detection face / landmark detection accuracy.
</p>

<h2>Can I use 3D models that don't have textures?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Yes. Face registration and landmark placement should all still work
and all of the measurements are geometric in nature. The only
issue that you will encounter is in generating model embedded PDF reports;
since there's no texture, the model won't appear even though it's present
in the generated document (see below).
</p>

<h2>Can I compare measurements between two different images?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Yes. Simply perform face registration / landmark detection on both faces which will
bring them into the same alignment. Then they can be compared within the same viewer,
or moved into their own viewers for clarity. To compare specific measurements, ensure
the models are in their own separate viewers and open the <em>Measurements Browser</em>.
As you select different measurements, the values of for both faces will be displayed
in the bottom left of their respective viewers for easy comparison.
</p>

<h2>Why don't some of the measurements have growth curve data?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Cliniface uses growth curve data from decades of research into facial anthropometrics.
Most of the facial measurements taken have been simple distance
measurements obtained using rulers, tape measures, or callipers, or angle measurements
taken using protractors or other specialist devices, and these measurements have largely
been taken from participants of European / Caucasian descent. Research is now
being conducted on faces of people of different ethnicities using a wider range of
metric types - a lot of this work facilitated by 3D imaging systems and applications
like Cliniface that can help researchers and clinicians to record and generate
statistics for different demographic cohorts.
</p>
<p>One of our aims is to include as much of this knowledge as possible within
Cliniface (growth curve data in particular) to make it easy for others to make use of
this work. However, much of the work done on Cliniface is unfunded, so finding and
incorporating new data may take some time. If you're aware of some statistics about
certain measurements for a particular demographic that you'd like to see included in
Cliniface, <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> and we'll be all too happy to
include it! You might even be conducting research yourself and collecting facial
measurements. If that's the case, Cliniface is a great way of making the results
of your efforts visible to others so let us know!
</p>

<h2>Can I use different statistics or add my own?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
All of the measurement statistics and definitions of measurements
are stored as Lua scripts within Cliniface's installation directory and they can be changed
or added to. However, incorrectly adding new measurements or statistics without understanding
the format of the scripts or what's allowed may break Cliniface. Experiment at your own risk!
</p>
<p>If you do have your own statistics that you'd like Cliniface to make use of,
<a href="contact.html">let us know</a> and we can incorporate them into the software
properly and make sure that links to your paper online are shown when your statistics
are being used in Cliniface.
</p>

<h2>Why isn't the reporting function available?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
First, give it another 10 seconds and check again. Cliniface needs to cache a copy of the model
in a different format after registering the anthropometric mask against
the model or after first loading a model from a previous session. If it's a complex model
and you're on a slow machine, it might just take a bit longer to cache.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Another possibility is that the version of <em>pdflatex</em> that Cliniface is set to use
does not understand the parameters that Cliniface passes to it. On Linux, try your package
manager's version of LaTeX. You might also not have the required LaTeX packages to
generate the report. Try running Cliniface from the command line and see what error
messages you get. Cliniface will first produce the .tex file in a temporary directory.
You might want to try taking a copy of the generated .tex file and experimenting with
<em>pdflatex</em> to see if LaTeX parses and generates the PDF okay outside of Cliniface.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Finally, if on Windows, check if you have Cliniface installed correctly. Cliniface
should work okay installed as a regular program in the system's "Program Files"
folder, but there's a chance that users without administrator privileges will run
into permission issues. Try reinstalling Cliniface in the suggested default (home)
directory and try again.
</p>

<h2>Why can't I see any 3D model in the PDF report that Cliniface generated?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
At time of writing, only Adobe's Acrobat Reader is widely known to be able to render
3D content within PDFs. Try opening the PDF using the latest version of that software
and make sure you enable 3D content for the document when asked. If you're not asked
and you still can't see the 3D content, it might be that this has been permanently
disabled within Acrobat Reader's settings.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
The other possibility is that you've generated a PDF with a 3D model that is not textured.
Non-textured models are white on a white background so that could be why you're not seeing it!
Try generating the PDF using a textured model to see if that works for you.
In future releases of Cliniface, I'll make it so you can see non-textured models
using abitrarily coloured surfaces.
</p>

<h2>Why do the text and icons look weirdly scaled on my 4K touch screen?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Some versions of Windows don't do application UI scaling very well with the version
of Qt that Cliniface uses. Updating Windows might help. Or you could use the Linux version ;D.
Failing that, try setting your monitor to a lower resolution if it's really a problem.
Also, fire me off an email with a screenshot showing how bad it is and I might look into
it more at my end - see if I can do something different with the icons / font sizes etc
for a future release.
</p>

<h2>Why is it so slow and unresponsive when moving the camera or model around?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
You need a half decent graphics card, or a modern CPU with decent integrated graphics
(anything from three or four years ago should be okay).  Also, check to ensure that
your machine is actually <em>using</em> your dedicated graphical processing unit (GPU)
for 3D rendering. If you're on Windows, it <em>should</em> detect that your GPU needs
to be rendering the graphics. On recent versions of Windows 10, you can manually
set Cliniface to run on the GPU by default when starting it (from Window's right
click menu). Also, for the best performance, make sure you're only rendering a single
model in a single viewer at a time. Graphics performance is also highly dependent on
the complexity of the model(s) being viewed (i.e., the number of graphical primitives
used to render the surface). On Linux, graphics drivers can be a bit hit and miss
but the same basic tips apply. See your distribution specific help on installing
hardware graphics drivers.
</p>

<h2>Can I use Cliniface without having 3D images?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Currently, no. Cliniface works with 3D images although it doesn't care from where these are obtained.
There are some example 3D images in Cliniface's installation direction (in the <em>examples</em> folder) if
you want to play around with what Cliniface can do.
</p>

<h2>Can I use Cliniface in my research?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Certainly! Cliniface was built to help both clinicians and researchers so we're very happy to see
it being used in this way. Please remember to cite Cliniface properly in your work (see
<em>About</em> under the <em>Help</em> menu for more details).
</p>

<h2>Why can't Cliniface do X?</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Maybe it should! <a href="contact.html">Email us</a> and let us know how great you think
feature X would be in Cliniface. If you convince us and if it's aligned with our
vision, we'll maybe try to incorporate the feature in a future release.
</p>

<h2>I really like Cliniface!</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
That's not a question, but if you want to show some love, then I'll have a
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/richeytastic">latte</a>. Thank you!
