<p>Cliniface is an application for interactively visualising and analysing 3D facial images. Cliniface
automatically records facial measurements and flags potentially significant dysmorphic traits by comparing
them against growth curve statistics matched to the subject's demographic. These traits are reported
as Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms which have disease/gene associations. By combining the
HPO terms discovered by Cliniface with other phenotypic information (as well as medical/family
histories etc), a clinician can more effectively arrive at a possible diagnosis.
Cliniface can then summarise the results of the analysis in a PDF report containing the
3D facial image as a fully manipulable model.
</p>
<p>Cliniface takes over fifty measurements from different parts of the face including distances,
depth, angles, and asymmetry. In addition, Cliniface provides "virtual callipers" giving the
user the ability to record their own measurements in an intuitive and easy to use manner.
Visualisations of asymmetry and curvature are also provided to help clinicians more effectively
interpret the facial surface.
</p>
<p>All measurements and results are saved in non-proprietary text based formats and can be
exported to XML or JSON format for follow-up analysis in third-party applications. Cliniface
works with 3D facial models stored in a wide variety of formats including formats without texture information.
The protection and privacy of your data is ensured because all processing is carried out on your own machine.
</p>
<p>Cliniface is free and open source. If you find Cliniface useful and would like to help us to improve it,
or you'd simply like to use it in your own research, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> for further details.
