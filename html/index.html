<p>Cliniface is an application for interactively visualising, analysing, investigating anthropometrics, and detecting dysmorphological traits from 3D facial images. These traits are identified as Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms which have disease/gene associations. By combining the HPO terms discovered by Cliniface with other phenotypic information (as well as medical/family histories etc), a clinician can more effectively arrive at a possible diagnosis.
</p>
<p>Cliniface works by fitting standard anthropometric landmarks to the 3D facial image and then taking measurements defined by the landmark positions. The measurements are compared to demographically matched statistics describing normal growth. Typically, if measurements are found to be outside of normal variation, this contributes to the flagging of an associated HPO term.
The facial landmarks are found using a template anthropometric mask (AM) which is non-rigidly deformed to map to the subject's face. The facial landmarks are transferred from the mask to the subject's face providing the anthropometric correspondence. Landmark placement can be refined manually if required. Demographic data about the subject (date of birth, sex, maternal and paternal ethnicity) must be entered in order to allow matching of growth curve statistics and automatic detection of atypical facial traits. Cliniface also includes visualisations of asymmetry and curvature, and "virtual callipers" to allow ad hoc measurements of surface and straight line distance, depth, and angles.
</p>
<p>Cliniface accepts 3D files in a variety of standard formats, and its analysis is saved into the 3DF file format which embeds metadata and analytic results as structured plain text alongside the original model data saved in Wavefront OBJ format. Measurements and other metadata can also be exported as structured data in XML and JSON formats so that users can undertake further analysis outside of Cliniface. These formats are described in more detail <a href="fileformats.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>Cliniface is free and open source and all analysis is performed locally to protect you and your patients' privacy.
