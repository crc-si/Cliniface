<hr>

<p>Cliniface lets clinicians interactively visualise, measure, analyse, and export data and reports
about 3D facial images taken of their patients.
Cliniface records a comprehensive range of facial measurements and compares these against known statistics
of facial growth to automatically identify significant dysmorphic traits as standard Human Phenotype Ontology
(HPO) terms which have disease/gene associations. By combining the HPO terms reported by Cliniface with other
phenotypic information (including medical/family histories etc), a clinician is better able to quickly and
accurately arrive at a potential diagnosis.
Cliniface can then summarise the analysis in a PDF report, or export the analysis to CSV (or other text formats)
for detailed follow-up investigations if required.
</p>
<p>Cliniface takes over fifty measurements from different parts of the face including distances,
depth, angles, and asymmetry. In addition, Cliniface offers clinicians the ability to record their
own measurements on the 3D facial image in an intuitive and easy manner using "virtual callipers".
Visualisations of asymmetry and curvature are also provided to help clinicians more effectively
interpret the facial surface.
</p>
<p>Cliniface works with 3D facial models stored in a wide variety of formats including formats without texture information.
The protection and privacy of subject information is ensured because all processing is carried out on your own machine.
</p>
<p>Cliniface is free and open source. If you find Cliniface useful and would like to help us to improve it,
or you'd like to use it to help in your own research, please <a href="/contact.html">contact us</a> for further details.
