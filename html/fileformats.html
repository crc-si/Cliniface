<h2 id="csv">Exporting to CSV</h2>
<p>Metadata about the current image can be exported to CSV, JSON, or XML formats. The JSON and XML formats
use the same element types which are described in more detail <a href="#ff_3df">below</a>. Unlike the JSON and
XML formats, the data layout in the CSV file format is more rigid so it can be opened in applications
such as Excel to quickly allow for further analysis of the measurement data provided by Cliniface.
Unlike the XML and JSON export formats, when exporting to CSV, only data for the image's current
assessor are exported. The current assessor is saved within the 3DF file to allow export to CSV using
Cliniface's <a href="cmdline.html">command line interface</a>.
</p>
<p>The data in the CSV file are laid out in five sections. Each section comprises one or more rows/lines.
The details of each section are given below.
</p>

<h3 id="csv">Section 1: Subject/Image Summary</h3>
<p>The first two lines in the CSV file provide information about the subject/image.
There are 12 fields/columns in the first line ordered as: image reference, subject reference,
subject's sex, subject's date of birth, image capture date, subject's age at image capture,
subject's maternal ethnicity, subject's paternal ethnicity, study reference, image source,
assessor's name, and the assessor's notes.
The second line has four fields/columns saying how many lines/rows are in each of the remaining
four sections which in order record: landmarks, measurements, calliper (user) measurements, and HPO terms.
</p>

<h3 id="csv">Section 2: Landmarks</h3>
<p>The second section records landmark positions - a single facial landmark per line (bilateral landmarks
are recorded over two lines). The fields per line are ordered as: the unique landmark identifier,
the landmark's name, the face lateral with respect to the subject ((L)eft, (R)ight, or (M)edial),
and the landmark's xyz position (three fields/columns).
</p>

<h3 id="csv">Section 3: Measurements</h3>
<p>The third section records measurements - one measurement per line.
The fields per line are ordered as: the unique measurement identifier, the measurement's name,
the face lateral with respect to the subject ((L)eft, (R)ight, or (M)edial),
the number of dimensions (values) for the measurement, and values themselves (one value per field/column).
</p>

<h3 id="csv">Section 4: User Defined Calliper Measurements</h3>
<p>The fourth section records user defined calliper measurements - one calliper measurement per line.
The fields per line are ordered as: the unique calliper measurement identifier, the name of
the calliper measurement (may be blank), the xyz position of one end of the measurement (3 fields), the xyz
position of the other end of the measurement (3 fields), the xyz position of the "depth" handle (3 fields),
the orientation vector (3 fields), the Euclidean (straight line) distance between the two ends of the
measurement (1 field), the distance along the surface of the facial model between the measurement endpoints (1 field),
the depth given the position of the "depth" handle (1 field), the angle at the point of depth (1 field),
and the cross sectional area (1 field). See <a href="metrics.html#_calliper_measurements">here</a> for more
information about taking calliper measurements.
</p>

<h3 id="csv">Section 5: Discovered HPO Terms</h3>
<p>The final section give information about the phenotypic traits (HPO terms) automatically discovered by
Cliniface (if any). Each line gives the following ordered fields: the HPO term identifier, the name of the
HPO term, the unique identifiers of the measurements involved in the objective determination of this
HPO term (a comma delimited list of values in a SINGLE field/column), with the final four fields
being true/false values stating whether or not the statistics used in the criteria for determining
the presence of the HPO term were a match for the subject's demographics.
The first of these values is true if and only if the subject's age was within the statistics of the
growth curve statistics used. The second value is true if and only if the subject's sex matched
the statistics used. The third and fourth values are true if and only if the subject's maternal
and paternal ethnicity (respectively) matched.
</p>

<h2 id="ff_3df">The 3DF Format</h2>
<p>A 3DF file is a ZIP-format archive with the .3df extension. It contains all data required to reproduce
the original 3D facial image plus measurement and mask coregistration mapping information. Image metadata
are stored in XML format and are described below.
</p>

<p>
<code>
Element: <strong>faces</strong><br>
Parents: <br>
Children: description, FaceModels<br>
</code>
The outer element for the 3DF file format. Has attribute "version" specifying the
version of the file format used. Allows for the inclusion of several different models.
</p>

<p>
<code>
Element: <strong>description</strong><br>
Parents: faces <br>
Value type: string<br>
</code>
Provides a description of the set of face models stored in the 3DF file. Cliniface uses
this element to store a semi-colon delimited set of tokens with the first token being the
description of the file as simply "3D Face Image and Metadata", and the second token being the
Unix timestamp of when the 3DF file was last saved.
</p>

<p>
<code>
Element: <strong>FaceModels</strong><br>
Parents: faces <br>
Children: FaceModel<br>
</code>
Container element for one or many FaceModel elements. Has attribute "count" specifying
the number of FaceModel elements contained in the archive.
</p>

<h2 id="element_definitions">Exporting Structured Data</h2>
<p>Cliniface can export and import data in XML and JSON structured data formats. Both of these formats
use the same identifying elements for the organisation of their data. The following section defines
each element, its position in the data structure, and its relationship to parent/child elements.
</p>
<p>Each of the following sections describes a single data element. For each element, the name
of the element and its parent element(s) are listed. If more than one parent is specified,
the element can appear in any of the listed locations. If the element contains other elements,
those other elements are listed as children. If the element contains a value, the value type
of the container is given. This can be a string, a date, a real, an integer, or a boolean.
Finally, a short description explains how the element is used.
