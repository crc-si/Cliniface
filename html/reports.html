<center><h1>Report Scripting</h1></center>
<hr>

<p>After loading a 3D image with registered mask and landmarks or after landmark registration, 
PDF reporting options will become available. A choosing to generate a report, the choice is
for the currently selected model and the currently selected assessment (if there are
multiple assessors for the image). At the time of writing, only Adobe's Acrobat Reader is widely
capable of rendering 3D content within PDFs.
<h2>Standard Reports</h2>
<p>
By default, Cliniface comes with three built-in reports with the following names:
<ul>
    <li>PDF Embedded 3D Model</li>
    <li>Facial Dysmorphology Summary</li>
    <li>Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) Analysis<li>
</ul>

<p>The first is simply what it states: the selected model embedded within a PDF. Useful if you just
want to send someone a 3D face and they don't have (or know how to use) 3D viewing software.
</p>

<p>The second report also provides a summary (list) underneath the model of any detected dysmorphologic traits.
</p>

<p>The third is a report specifically for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder in that it provides information
about some of the sentinel facial features of FASD.
</p>

<p>More report options may be available if extra plugins are loaded.
</p>

<p>
Cliniface includes limited scripting options for generating your own PDF reports with embedded 3D models.
All reports are stored as Lua scripts in Cliniface's installation directory in <em>bin/data/reports</em>.
In particular, see the file "report_test.lua" for an example of a report (this particular report is
disabled in Cliniface's release build).
</p>
<p>
Report scripts have four entries: two values, and two functions. The two values are the name and title
of the report. The name is what's listed in Cliniface's dialog when providing the user with the list
of reports to choose from. The title is what's written at the top of the generated report.
</p>
<p>The <em>available</em> function defines the conditions under which the report can be generated.
Typically this just entails the availability of landmarks on the model.
</p>
<p>The content of the report is specified by the <em>addContent</em> function. Content should be
given as either a single page, or as two columns with the <em>addStartColumn</em> and <em>addEndColumn</em>
functions defining the start and end of the vertical columns of content. Functions that insert content
are:
</p>
<h2>addScanInfo</h2>
<p>Inserts demographic information about the subject taken from the <em>Assessment Information</em> dialog.
</p>
<h2>addNotes</h2>
<p>Inserts the assessor's notes taken from the <em>Assessment Information</em> dialog.
</p>
<h2>addPhenotypicVariationsList</h2>
<p>Inserts the list of HPO terms identified by Cliniface as being present according to the objective
criteria of those phenotypic traits.
</p>
<h2>addLineBreak</h2>
<p>Inserts a line break.</p>
<h2>addFigure</h2>
<p>Embed the 3D model at this location in the report.
Specify width and height in millimetres and a caption as arguments to this function.
</p>
<h2>addGrowthCurvesChart</h2>
<p>Add the growth curve statistics chart for a metric.
As arguments to this function, specify the metric identifier, the dimension, and the footnote index.
</p>
<h2>addCustomLatex</h2>
<p>Add any raw LaTeX string (as a parameter to this function).</p>
<h2>addFootnoteSources</h2>
<p>Add sources as footnotes - takes a dictionary of metric identifiers as argument.</p>
<h2>footnoteIndices</h2>
<p>Obtain the footnote indices for the argument dictionary of metric identifiers. Needed
when making citations within the report.</p>
<h2>metric</h2>
<p>Get the argument metric.</p>
<h2>metricSource</h2>
<p>Get the current source of the argument metric.</p>

<h2>MetricSet (object)</h2>
<p>Has property: metric (a metric value from the set)</p>

<h2>MetricValue (object)</h2>
<p>Has properties:<br>
ndims (the number of dimensions of the metric)<br>
value (the value of the metric)<br>
zscore (the Z score of the metric)<br>
mean (the mean value of the metric)
</p>

<h2>GrowthData (object)</h2>
<p>Has properties:<br>
source (reference)<br>
note (information about the data)<br>
longNote (detailed notes about the data)
</p>

<h2>FM (object)</h2>
<p>A 3D face model. Has properties:<br>
age<br>
sex<br>
studyId<br>
maternalEthnicity<br>
paternalEthnicity<br>
captureDate<br>
dateOfBirth<br>
currentAssessment
</p>

<h2>FaceAssessment</h2>
<p>An assessment of a face. Has properties:<br>
hasLandmarks<br>
metrics (the centre line metrics)<br>
metricsL (metrics from the left lateral)<br>
metricsR (metrics from the right lateral)
</p>

<p>More details on these functions to be added in subsequent versions.
