<center><h1>Report Scripting</h1></center>
<hr>

<p>After loading a 3D image with landmarks or after landmark registration, reporting options
become available. Reports are generated for the currently selected model and assessment on that model.
At the time of writing, only Adobe's Acrobat Reader is known to be capable of rendering 3D content within PDFs.
</p>

<h2>Standard Reports</h2>
<p>Cliniface comes with three built-in reports.</p>

<h3>Facial Morphology Summary</h3>
<p>The morphological summary includes subject/image and assessment information,
the 3D face as an embedded and fully manipulable model, and beneath this a summary
of any notable morphology detected by Cliniface. Each trait list is a hyperlink out
to the online HPO database.
</p>

<h3>Model Only</h3>
<p>Simply includes the fully manipulable model embedded inside the generated PDF.
Note that subject/image/study/source references are still shown in the report's header.
</p>

<h3>Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD)</h3>
<p>A report specifically detailing measurements about sentinel facial features of FASD.
The report is formatted as two columns. The left column includes the same information
as the standard facial morphology summary. The right column contains information specific
to the FASD facial features.
</p>

<p>More report options may be available if extra plugins are loaded.</p>

<h2>Report Scripting</h2>
<p>Cliniface includes scripting functionality for generating custom reports with embedded 3D models.
All reports are stored as Lua scripts in Cliniface's installation directory in <em>bin/data/reports</em>.
The reports are loaded when Cliniface starts and appear in the report generation dialog.
See the file <em>bin/data/reports/report_test.lua</em> for an example of correct report syntax.
</p>
<p>Report scripts have four entries: two values, and two functions. The two values are the name and title
of the report. The name is what's listed in Cliniface's report generation dialog. The title is printed
in the header of the generated report.
</p>
<p>Function <em>isAvailable</em> should return true if the report can be generated given the provided
model. The contents of this function should test the state of the given model to see if a report can
be generated for it. Typically this just entails checking the availability of landmarks on the model.
</p>
<p>Function <em>addContent</em> specifies the report's actual content. This should be either a single page,
or as two columns using the <em>addStartColumn</em> and <em>addEndColumn</em> functions which define the start
and end of vertical columns of content. Functions that insert content are listed <a href="#content_fns">below</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="content_fns">Content Scripting Functions</h2>
<p>The following functions are used to define the layout of content within the report's <em>addContent</em> function.</p>
<h4>addScanInfo</h4>
<p>Inserts information about the subject taken from the <em>Assessment Information</em> dialog.</p>

<h4>addNotes</h4><p>Inserts the assessor's notes taken from the <em>Assessment Information</em> dialog.</p>

<h4>getNumPhenotypicTraits</h4>
<p>Returns the number of phenotypic traits found by Cliniface for the current model and assessment.</p>

<h4>addPhenotypicTraits</h4>
<p>Inserts a sublist of the ID sorted HPO terms found by Cliniface as present according to the objective
criteria of those phenotypic traits. Pass the starting index of the trait to print and the number of
traits to print. Each trait is placed on its own line as a hyperlink out to the online database of
HPO terms. The function returns true iff more traits remain to be printed.
</p>

<h4>addLineBreak</h4><p>Inserts a line break.</p>

<h4>addFigure</h4>
<p>Embed the 3D model at this location in the report. Specify width and height
in millimetres and a caption as arguments to this function.
</p>

<h4>addGrowthCurvesChart</h4>
<p>Add the growth curve statistics chart for a metric.
As arguments to this function, specify the metric identifier, the dimension, and the footnote index.
</p>

<h4>addCustomLatex</h4><p>Add any raw LaTeX string (as a parameter to this function).</p>

<h4>addFootnoteSources</h4><p>Add sources as footnotes - takes a dictionary of metric identifiers as argument.</p>

<h4>footnoteIndices</h4>
<p>Obtain the footnote indices for the argument dictionary of metric identifiers. Needed
when making citations within the report.</p>

<h4>metric</h4><p>Get the argument metric.</p>

<h4>metricSource</h4><p>Get the current source of the argument metric.</p>

<h4>MetricSet (object)</h4><p>Has property: metric (a metric value from the set)</p>

<h4>MetricValue (object)</h4>
<p>Has properties:<br>
ndims (the number of dimensions of the metric)<br>
value (the value of the metric)<br>
zscore (the Z score of the metric)<br>
mean (the mean value of the metric)
</p>

<h4>GrowthData (object)</h4>
<p>Has properties:<br>
source (reference)<br>
note (information about the data)<br>
longNote (detailed notes about the data)
</p>

<h4>FM (object)</h4>
<p>A 3D face model. Has properties:<br>
age<br>
sex<br>
studyId<br>
maternalEthnicity<br>
paternalEthnicity<br>
captureDate<br>
dateOfBirth<br>
currentAssessment
</p>

<h4>FaceAssessment</h4>
<p>An assessment of a face. Has properties:<br>
hasLandmarks<br>
metrics (the centre line metrics)<br>
metricsL (metrics from the left lateral)<br>
metricsR (metrics from the right lateral)
</p>
