<center><h1>Summary of Functions</h1></center>
<hr>

<p>Cliniface's interface is made up of menus and toolbars along the top of the main window,
the viewing region for the 3D images, and a dropdown list of the open files at the bottom of
the window with buttons either side for copying and moving models between Cliniface's three
viewers (only one viewer is visible initially). Any greyed out button corresponds to a currently
unavailable action (usually because a model isn't selected). The buttons on the toolbars show
only the most commonly used functions. The menus can be used to access nearly all available functions in Clinface.
</p>
<p>Cliniface's functionality is described below grouped by parent menu category. Some functions are
only available in the context of making and analysing measurements. More details on these functions
can be found in the <a href="metrics.html">measurements</a> section.

<br>
<h2 id="file_menu">File</h2>
<p><strong>Open</strong> a 3D image.</p>
<p><strong>Save</strong> the active model at its current file location.</p>
<p><strong>Save As</strong>.
Save the active model under a different file name/location. Save models in the 3DF file format to retain
the metadata Cliniface needs for its analysis. See <a href="fileformats.html#ff_3df">here</a> for more
information on the 3DF file format.</p>
<p><strong>Import Metadata</strong> in XML or JSON format and overwrite the active model's metadata.
See <a href="fileformats.html#element_definitions">here</a> for more information on the metadata import/export format.</p>
<p><strong>Export Metadata</strong> from the currently selected model to CSV, JSON, or XML format.
See <a href="fileformats.html#element_definitions">here</a> for more information on the metadata import/export format.</p>
<p><strong>Undo</strong> the last action carried out.</p>
<p><strong>Redo</strong> the last action carried out.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment Information</strong>.
Open the <em>Assessment Information</em> dialog where subject demographics and assessment notes can be entered.
Demographic data about subjects is needed for Cliniface to know which measurements are atypical for flagging HPO terms.</p>
<p><strong>Model Properties</strong>.
Display a summary of the active model's geometry.</p>
<p><strong>Create Template Report</strong>.
Create and save a PDF report about the active model.</p>
<p><strong>Close</strong> the active model.</p>
<p><strong>Close All</strong> currently open models.</p>
<p><strong>Quit</strong>.
Close all models and quit.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="view_menu">View</h2>
<p><strong>Texture</strong>.
Toggle visibility of the model's texture map (or return to surface view).</p>
<p><strong>Wireframe</strong>.
Toggle visibility of the geometric wireframe mesh.</p>
<p><strong>Manifold Boundaries</strong>.
Toggle visibility of surface manifold outlines.</p>
<p><strong>Show Correspondence Mask</strong>.
Toggle visibility of the correspondence mask (anthopometric mask). Only available after landmark detection;
it shows the result of the non-rigid anthropometric mask registration process.</p>
<p><strong>Median Plane</strong>.
Toggle visibility of the mid-sagittal (medial) plane (after landmark placement).</p>
<p><strong>Transverse Plane</strong>.
Toggle visibility of the transverse plane (after landmark placement).</p>
<p><strong id="radial_select">Select Radial Area</strong>.
Interactively select a region around a point. Use in combination with the
<a href="#cropping_tool">face extraction tool</a> to remove unwanted parts
of the model. Click and drag the centre handle to move the extraction region
around and use forwards and backwards on the mouse wheel to change the radial size of the region.</p>
<p><strong>Triangle Labels</strong>.
Toggle visibility of the individual polygon identifiers.</p>
<p><strong>Vertex Labels</strong>.
Toggle visibility of the individual vertex identifiers.</p>
<p><strong>Backface Culling</strong>.
On by default, this prevents the inside facing surface of the model from being rendered.
Sometimes, the inside and outside surfaces of a model are incorrectly defined due to the
ordering of vertices for each triangle. In this case Cliniface's <a href="#invert_normals">invert normals tool</a>
can be used to swap the inside and outside surfaces of the model.</p>
<p><strong>World Axes</strong>.
Toggle visibility of the world axes grid.</p>
<p><strong>Take Screenshot (All Viewers)</strong>.
Save a screenshot of the viewers. If the left or right viewers are in use, the images from
them are horizontally concatenated into a single image before saving.</p>
<p><strong>Show 3D (Red/Blue)</strong>.
Toggle anaglyphic 3D rendering. Red/blue anaglyph glasses are needed to see the 3D effect.</p>
<p><strong>Visualisations Toolbar</strong>.
Toggle the visualisations toolbar on and off.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="surface_mapping">Surface Mapping (View submenu)</h2>
<p><strong>Scalar Legend</strong>.
Toggle the legend on and off when visualising scalar mappings of the model's surface.</p>
<p><strong>Asymmetry [All] (mm)</strong>
Shows the relative difference in three dimensions between the two lateral halves of the face according
to the anthropometrically mapped mask. Asymmetry is shown as positive or negative. If positive, that
area is tumid relative to the corresponding area on the opposite lateral. If negative, it is
shrunken relative to the opposite lateral. By default, asymmetry is shown in five colour bands
of severity within the range +/- 5.0 mm (2 mm per band) but this can be changed from the visualisations
toolbar.</p>
<p><strong>Asymmetry [X] (mm)</strong>
Shows lateral asymmetry through the mid-sagittal plane of the face only (superior/inferior
and anterior/posterior asymmetry not shown).</p>
<p><strong>Asymmetry [Y] (mm)</strong>
Shows vertical (superior/inferior) asymmetry only (lateral and anterior/posterior asymmetry not shown).</p>
<p><strong>Asymmetry [Z] (mm)</strong>
Shows depth (anterior/posterior) asymmetry only (lateral and superior/inferior asymmetry not shown).</p>
<p><strong>Mean Curvature (degs)</strong>.
Shows average curvature in degrees around each polygon (triangle). This is an average of the curvature
at each triangle's three vertices inversely weighted by the proportional areas of adjacent
triangles. Negative values are convex and positive values are concave. The sign of the
curvature depends upon the orientation of the surface normals. The range of curvature
displayed by default is +/- 45 degrees in 6 degree bands though these settings can
be changed from the visualisatios toolbar.</p>
<p><strong>Absolute Curvature (degs)</strong>.
Shows the absolute value of the mean curvature. By default this is shown in the range [0,45] degrees
in 9 bands of 5 degrees each.</p>
<p><strong>Right (+X) Orientation</strong>.
Shows scalar values proportional to the magnitude of each triangle's surface normal projected
along the positive X axis (the global X axis if no landmarks are present to provide alignment,
otherwise the X axis given by the facial alignment).</p>
<p><strong>Up (+Y) Orientation</strong>.
Shows scalar values proportional to the magnitude of each triangle's surface normal projected along the positive Y axis.</p>
<p><strong>Forward (+Z) Orientation</strong>.
Shows scalar values proportional to the magnitude of each triangle's surface normal projected along the positive Z axis.</p>
<p><strong>Vertex Normal Mapping</strong>.
Toggles visibility of arrows oriented with polygon surface normals, the magnitudes of which depend upon
the currenly selected scalar mapping.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="visualisations">Visualisations (toolbar)</h2>
<p><strong>Opacity</strong>.
The leftmost spinbox widget on the toolbar (left of the <em>World Axes</em> button)
specifies how opaque the selected model is. Maximum opacity is always 1.0 but the
range is scaled based on context. In particular, if models are overlapping in the
same viewer, the maximum opacity is limited so that both models are visible.
</p>
<p><strong>Surface Mapping Range</strong>.
The next spinbox on the toolbar (right of the <em>World Axes</em> button) specifies
the absolute range of the displayed values for the currently selected surface (scalar)
visualisation. This widget is greyed-out if a surface visualisation is not currently
visible on the selected model.
</p>
<p><strong>Number of Surface Mapping Colour Bands</strong>.
The rightmost spinbox on the toolbar (immediately to the right of the <em>Surface Mapping Range</em> spinbox)
specifies the number of colour bands shown for the selected surface mapping (i.e., the coarseness of the
scalar bins) over the current range.
</p>

<br>
<h2 id="camera_menu">Camera</h2>
<p><strong>View Front Profile</strong>.
Set the camera to view the subject's front facial profile, or the front side of the model if no landmarks are placed.</p>
<p><strong>View Right Profile</strong>.
Set the camera to view the subject's right facial profile, or the right side of the model if no landmarks are placed.</p>
<p><strong>View Right Quarter</strong>.
Set the camera to view the subject's right front quarter facial profile, or the right front quarter of the model
if no landmarks are placed.</p>
<p><strong>View Left Quarter</strong>.
Set the camera to view the subject's left front quarter facial profile, or the left front quarter of the model
if no landmarks are placed.</p>
<p><strong>View Left Profile</strong>.
Set the camera to view the subject's left facial profile, or the left side of the model if no landmarks are placed.</p>
<p><strong>View From Above</strong>.
Set the camera to view the subject from above.</p>
<p><strong>View Top Quarter</strong>.
Set the camera to view the subject from above and front.</p>
<p><strong>View From Below</strong>.
Set the camera to view the subject from below.</p>
<p><strong>View Bottom Quarter</strong>.
Set the camera to view the subject from below and front.</p>
<p><strong>Orthographic Projection</strong>.
Toggle between orthographic and perspective (default) projection. When the measurements are being visualised,
orthographic projection is automatically toggled on (unless this behaviour is changed in the preferences).</p>
<p><strong>Synchronise Cameras</strong>.
If toggled on, the cameras for each viewer will be synchronised so that camera movement in one viewer is
replicated across the others.</p>
<p><strong>Marquee Mode</strong>.
Toggles automatic rotating and panning of the cameras in each viewer about their foci. Useful for presentations.
Normal mouse controlled camera interaction is overridden while this mode is active. Toggle off to return
to normal interactio or click one of the predefined camera views (e.g., front view with the <em>SPACE</em> key).
</p>

<br>
<h2 id="transform_menu">Transform</h2>
<p><strong>Align Model</strong>.
Try to align the model in a centred and upright position. If landmarks are set, the face is aligned
in Frankfort horizontal (standard) position.</p>
<p><strong>Centre Model</strong>.
Set the centre of the model coincident with the zero (origin) point of the world axes.</p>
<p><strong>Rescale</strong>.
Rescale the model in one or more of the three spatial directions.</p>
<p><strong>Reflect Laterally</strong>.
Reflect the model through its YZ plane, or if landmarks are set through the mid-sagittal plane.</p>
<p><strong>Rotate 90 degrees about X</strong>.
Rotate the model anti-clockwise around the X axis by a quarter turn. If landmarks are set,
rotation is with respect to the landmark defined alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Rotate 90 degrees about Y</strong>.
Rotate the model anti-clockwise around the Y axis by a quarter turn. If landmarks are set,
rotation is with respect to the landmark defined alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Rotate 90 degrees about Z</strong>.
Rotate the model anti-clockwise around the Z axis by a quarter turn. If landmarks are set,
rotation is with respect to the landmark defined alignment.</p>
<p><strong>Manually Reposition</strong>.
Enter model movement mode where mouse interactions that normally move the camera with respect
to the model now move the model with respect to the camera. Clicking off the model reverts
back to normal camera interaction mode.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="geometry_menu">Geometry</h2>
<p><strong id="invert_normals">Invert Normals</strong>.
Swap vertex ordering defined for the model's polygons which has the effect of inverting all surface normals.
Use this where 3D capture systems do not agree on clockwise versus anti-clockwise vertex ordering of triangles
in the underlying mesh.</p>
<p><strong>Fill Holes</strong>.
Finds and fills holes in the surface of the model. Holes are filled naively as a plane of triangles.
This tool is meant to help fill small holes (of a few triangles) - not to reconstruct whole regions of the face.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Surface</strong>.
Smooth surface geometry in areas of sharp curvature. The threshold for acceptible curvature should
be set high enough to prevent important features from being lost. The smoothing threshold can be set
in Cliniface's <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a>. Mesh (vertex) connectivity is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong id="cropping_tool">Extract Facial Region</strong>.
Use after selecting a region with the <a href="#radial_select">radial selection tool</a> to remove
the parts of the model falling outside of the defined region. Alternatively, use without the radial
selection tool to allow Cliniface to make its best guess as to the facial region. With landmarks set,
and without using the radial selection tool, the facial region is extracted to be the minimum radially
defined facial surface containing all of the landmarks.</p>
<p><strong>Create Right Symmetric Face</strong>.
Take the right side of subject's facial model, reflect a copy of it, and use this as the
new left side of their face. Creates a perfectly symmetric face through the mid-sagittal
plane if landmarks are set. If no landmarks are set, the YZ plane is used as the reflecting plane.
The registered mask (if set) <em>is not made symmetric</em> and is invalid after this function.
If you want to work with the symmetric version of the subject's face, you should discard the existing
detection and redetect to ensure a better mask fit.</p>
<p><strong>Create Left Symmetric Face</strong>. As above for the opposite half of the face.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="metrics_menu">Metrics</h2>
<p><strong>Detect Face/Landmarks</strong>.
Detect the face and perform automatic landmark placement. This uses a non-rigid mapping
of a template facial mask to the subject's face. The template mask (and its landmarks)
can be set in Cliniface's preferences. If landmarks are already set, the user will
be asked to select the ones to overwrite with new positions.</p>
<p><strong>Discard Face Detection</strong>.
Removes the facial landmarks and the mapped correspondence mask <em>for all assessments</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Edit Landmarks</strong>.
Display the landmark browser and unlock landmark positions to enable editing by left-clicking
and dragging them to new positions. Landmark positins are relocked when this dialog is closed.</p>
<p><strong>Show Landmarks</strong> simply toggles visibility of the landmarks.</p>
<p><strong>Measurements Browser</strong>.
Display the list of measurements taken from the face as well as where on the face they are measured.
By default, projection mode is switched to orthographic when viewing measurements.
See <a href="metrics.html#_measurements_browser">here</a> for more information about selecting and making facial measurements.</p>
<p><strong>HPO Terms Browser</strong>.
Display the list of HPO terms that Cliniface is able to automatically identify through its measurements of the 3D facial surface.
See <a href="metrics.html#_hpo_browser">here</a> for more information about selecting and making facial measurements.</p>
<p><strong>Show Calliper Measurements</strong>.
Display any user defined calliper measurements for the current assessment.
See <a href="metrics.html#_calliper_measurements">here</a> for more information about calliper measurements.</p>
<p><strong>Discard ALL Calliper Measurements</strong>.
Deletes all calliper (user defined) measurements from the current assessment for the active model.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="help_menu">Help</h2>
<p><strong>Help</strong>.
The help system you're currently looking using.</p>
<p><strong>What's This?</strong>.
Some functions have context sensitive information - click this button then on a function to find out more about it.</p>
<p><strong>Preferences</strong>.
Display the <a href="preferences.html">preferences</a> dialog to configure Cliniface's behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Plugins</strong>.
Display the loaded plugins.</p>
<p><strong>About</strong>.
About Cliniface, how to cite it, and how to support our efforts.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="context_menu">Context (Right Click Menu)</h2>
<p><strong>Set Camera Focus</strong> to the location pointed at by the mouse upon right clicking.
This can also be achieved by pressing <em>F</em> with the mouse pointer hovering
over the new point to focus the camera upon.</p>
<p><strong>Add Calliper Measurement</strong> between two points on the surface of the model.
The calliper measurement is added as a user defined measurement to the current assessment.
Click and drag the end-points to place the measurement.
See <a href="metrics.html#_calliper_measurements">here</a> for more information about calliper measurements.</p>
<p><strong>Rename Calliper Measurement</strong>.
Calliper measurements are unnamed by default. Give them a name so they are easier for
others to reference (and to retrieve from exported XML/JSON data).</p>
<p><strong>Discard Calliper Measurement</strong>.
Delete the calliper measurement whose handle was under the mouse pointer at the time of right clicking.</p>
<p><strong>Restore Landmark Position</strong>.
Restore the position of the landmark under the mouse pointer to the automatically detected position.
Only available if the <em>Landmarks Browser</em> is open allowing landmarks to be repositioned.</p>
<p><strong>Select Radial Area</strong>.
Open the radial selection tool centred on the position under the mouse cursor.
If already on, selecting this turns radial selection mode off.</p>
<p><strong>Discard Manifold</strong>.
Discard the geometric manifold connected to the region under the mouse pointer.</p>
<p><strong>Discard OTHER Manifolds</strong>.
Discard the geometric manifolds other than the one connected to the region under the mouse pointer.</p>
