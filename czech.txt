THURSDAY

Comparing Morphome3CS use with Cliniface use.

* Add in logarthimic scale for scalar visualisations.

* Obtain asymmetry values from landmark points on the face.
    - Vector visualisation could be useful.

* Signed malananobis distance of single scan from a cohort.

* Command line export to PLY and or OBJ.

* Produce growth curves for the the Czech data.

* Construction of the mean face.

* Ensure that landmark positions are stated in the help.

* Rate of change of deformation to consider.
    - Ties into Claes work about normal equivalents.

* Outlier analysis from a specified directory stored cohort (metric wise).

* Draw outlines around regions you want to keep.

* Extract medial profile curve for comparison.

* Prof TD:
 - Require intra-oral scans superimposed within face in Cliniface.
 - Extend 3DF file format to allow the incorporation of multiple different
   scan types as layers with separate opacity measures.


FRIDAY

Doing some autism research and interested in the work that's been done around
surface distance between landmarks.
 - Provide the ability to record and store surface distances between landmarks pairs.
