Cliniface is free and open source software. Ongoing development is
supported by philanthropic donations and from grants received
through our research partnerships.

If you'd like to support Cliniface and its continued development, then
please consider donating to the project. If you'd like to partner
with us and use Cliniface in your research, or if you have a specific
idea for a research project that you think Cliniface might be useful for,
then please [contact us](mailto:r.l.palmer@curtin.edu.au)
directly and we'll be happy to discuss possibilities.
