<p>Cliniface is an application for interactively visualising and analysing 3D facial images. Cliniface
automatically records facial measurements and flags potentially significant dysmorphic traits by comparing
them against growth curve statistics matched to the subject's demographic. These traits are reported
as Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms which have disease/gene associations. By combining the
HPO terms discovered by Cliniface with other phenotypic information (as well as medical/family
histories etc), a clinician can more effectively arrive at a possible diagnosis.
Cliniface can then summarise the results of the analysis in a PDF report containing the
3D facial image as a fully manipulable model.
</p>
<p>Cliniface takes over fifty measurements from different parts of the face including distances,
depth, angles, and asymmetry. In addition, Cliniface provides "virtual callipers" giving the
user the ability to record their own measurements in an intuitive and easy to use manner.
Visualisations of asymmetry and curvature are also provided to help clinicians more effectively
interpret the facial surface.
</p>
<p>All measurements and results are saved in non-proprietary text based formats and can be
exported to XML or JSON format for follow-up analysis in third-party applications. Cliniface
works with 3D facial models stored in a wide variety of formats including formats without texture information.
The protection and privacy of your data is ensured because all processing is carried out on your own machine.
</p>
<p>Cliniface is free and open source. If you find Cliniface useful and would like to help us to improve it,
or you'd simply like to use it in your own research, please contact us for further details.

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>Cliniface is an open source project and having the time and money to keep on developing it is hard.
There's no such thing as funding to fix bugs or carry out boring efficiency improvements either,
so if you'd like to show some love, leave a message and help indulge my
<a href='https://ko-fi.com/V7V11MGQH' target='_blank'>coffee habit</a> or
chuck a few bucks at my <a href="https://paypal.me/richeytastic" class="uri">PayPal</a> wallet.
</p>
<p>Feedback is very important and helps to improve Cliniface for everyone. Got an idea for a
new feature? Think you've found a bug or that Cliniface is doing something weird?
Email me directly by clicking my name at the top of this page and I'll be pleased to hear from you.
If you want to get involved in an official capacity (research or development) or would like
to fund the development of specific features in Cliniface, then great! Email me and let's work
something out.
</p>

<h3>How to cite</h3>
<p>As well as developing Cliniface, we also use it conduct research.
If you use Cliniface for research, it's important to give due citations.
Cliniface uses a custom implementation of a third-party non-rigid registration algorithm and
also comes with a copy of the anthropometric mask created by that algorithm's authors (supplied with
permission), so please cite the following works:<br>
