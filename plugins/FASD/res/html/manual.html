<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The Fetal Alchohol Spectrum Disorder module for Cliniface is based upon the diagnostic assessment
methodology using the FASD 4-Digit Code for 2D images of faces developed by Susan J. (Astley) Hemingway,
Ph.D, Professor of Epidemiology/Pediatrics, and Director, WA State FAS Diagnostic &amp; Prevention
Network <a href="http://www.fasdpn.org">(FAS DPN)</a>.
While based upon this methodology, its application in Cliniface is for the measurement and
assessment of 3D facial models rather than of 2D facial images. Because this methodology is
still being validated in the 3D domain, the results it generates should not be considered to
have the same level of reliability as when the methodology is applied in its original 2D
image domain. Neither Dr. Hemingway, nor any of her affiliates were consulted during the
development of this plugin.
</p>
<h2>Using the FASD Module</h2>
<p>The FASD module is loaded if it is visible as an entry under Cliniface's <em>Metrics</em> menu.
The image below shows the FASD dialog that is shown when selected. The option is greyed out unless
the selected model has facial landmarks present. Information in the dialog is segmented into three
sections: <a href="#pfl">Palpebral Fissure Lengths (PFL)</a>,
<a href="#ulip">Upper Lip Fullness</a>, and <a href="#rankings">University of Washington Facial Diagnostic Rankings</a>.
Each section is described below.
</p>
<center><img src=":/images/FASD_DIALOG"/></center>

<h2 id="pfl">Palpebral Fissure Lengths (PFL)</h2>
<p>The left, right, and mean PFL lengths are shown according to the current model measurements of the
distance between the exocanthian (outer eye) and endocanthian (inner eye) landmarks.
</p>
<p>The Z-scores to the right of the measurement values are calculated according to the currently set
statistics for the PFL. Hovering the mouse over any of the z-score values shows the current reference for
the source of the growth curve statistics being used to calculate these values. To change the source
of the PFL growth curve statistics, open the <em>Measurements Browser</em> from the <em>Metrics</em>
menu, select the PFL metric from the table, uncheck the <em>Automatch</em> checkbox if checked,
and select the desired source from the dropdown list.
</p>
<p>All of the statistics in Cliniface provide the measurement as a point-to-point distance between
the canthi of each eye. By checking <em>In-plane</em> in the <em>Measurements Browser</em>, the PFL
distances will be recalculated as the projected distance into a plane parallel with the coronal plane.
Due to the nature of such projections, the calculated values will be smaller by a factor of cos &theta;
where &theta; is the angle of incidence between the PFL line and the coronal plane.
The 2D values calculated in this way are comparable to the PFL distances measured from 2D images
of faces (not accounting for the additional error factor due to perspective projection).
</p>
<p>A short mean palpebral fissure length results in a higher FASD <a href="#rankings">diagnostic ranking</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="ulip">Upper Lip Fullness</h2>
<p>The fullness of the upper lip (or circularity) is calculated as the square of the upper lip's
perimeter by its area. This metric was originally designed to be used in the context of 2D images
by having the user trace the perimeter of the upper vermilion in a photograph. Larger values
denote a thinner upper lip.
</p>
<p>In Cliniface, the perimeter of the upper lip is estimated using the landmarks around the
vermilion. These landmarks are <em>Stomion Superius (SS)</em>, <em>Left/Right Mid-labial Fissure Superius (MF)</em>,
<em>Left/Right Cheilion (C)</em>, <em>Left/Right Mid-vermilion Superius (MV)</em>,
<em>Left/Right Crista Philtri (CP)</em>, and <em>Labrale Superius (LS)</em>.
The area is calculated as the sum of the areas of the eight "inner" triangles as
shown in the diagram below.
</p>

<p>While the automatic demarcation of the perimeter using these landmarks is not as precise as
tracing the path exactly around the upper vermilion, the major components of the upper lip
contributing to its fullness score are captured by this method without having to manually
indicate where to exactly draw the upper lip perimeter. In addition, a 2D image projection
of the upper lip may (depending on the orientation of the mouth) inaccurately show the degree
of curvature of the upper or lower edges of the upper lip as being more or less horizontally
curved than in reality.
Projecting this metric into the frontal plane (simulating measurement from a 2D image)
results in the fullness metric being calculated differently than in 3D.
</p>
<p>The <em>Ethnicity Guide</em> should be manually set to one of the two available guides:
<em>Caucasian</em>, or <em>African American</em> so that the correct ranking can be scored
by thresholding on the circularity value. The thresholds used are the same as those for the
2D image guides about which more information can be found on page 30 of the
<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/pdfs/guide04.pdf">Diagnostic Guide For Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: The 4-Digit Diagnostic Guide</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="rankings">University of Washington Facial Diagnostic Rankings</h2>
<p>The University of Washington's FASD ABC 1-5 ranking system associates a numeric rank
from 1 to 5 and a scoring letter to each of the three sentinel features. The philtrum curvature
rank must be manually entered with reference to page 30 of the
<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/pdfs/guide04.pdf">Diagnostic Guide For Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders: The 4-Digit Diagnostic Guide</a>
ensuring that the same ethncity guide is used as set in the <a href="#ulip">Upper Lip Fullness</a>
section of the dialog. The image guides are not included in this software due to copyright restrictions.
</p>

<h2 id="report">Generating the FASD Report</h2>
<p>The FASD report can be generated either directly from the FASD dialog by clicking the report
generation button at the bottom left, or via Cliniface's report selection dialog accessible
from the <em>File</em> menu or using the toolbar button. The report summarises the content of
the FASD dialog box described here, generates and embeds the PFL growth curve statistics used,
and also embeds a 3D model of the subject's face together with demographic and assessment information.
